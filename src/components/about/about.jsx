        At first I studied in the Hochschule MÃ¼nchen. One of them was scientific
        comupting. I dropped out of the Hochschule and wanted to program from
        there on.

      <EntryBody.Text>
        I continued programming while I was thinking about what I can do with
        this new passion. I was deciding between two things:{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>teaching myself</li>
          <li>make an apprenticeship</li>
        </ul>
      </EntryBody.Text>
      <EntryBody.Text>
        I decided to do an apprenticeship, because in Germany a apprenticeship
        is worth much more than self learning skills.

        I landed started to apply for apprenticeships and landed one at the
        Deutsche Telekom. To be more precise I started working at the T-Systems
        Multimedia Solutions GmbH, which is subsidiary of the Deutsch Telekom.

        At the T-Systems I worked as Frontend Softwaredeveloper for AR/VR
        devices. We created apps to allow customers to discover new marketing
        strategies with AR/VR.

        During my apprenticeship I thought about new technologies that I could
        work with. I fell in love with the frontend development and the most
        common frontend are the browser windows when searching for something in
        the internet. I learned react.
      </EntryBody.Text>
      <EntryBody.Text>
        I successfully graduated from my apprenticeship and searched for a job
        as Frontend Developer in the area web development. At first I started a
        job, which was not suitable for me. I continued my search and landed at
        Check24.
